Hi there, I'm an [INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality), brewing web applications with **_Js, Python, and Coffee_**. Currently working at a multi-disciplinary **_StartUp Incubator_** named [Tero Labs](https://www.terolabs.org/) to help **_Web3/Crypto_** startups build their products, as a Software Engineer. I'm also building a fully-remote technical agency that provides everything from highly complex technical solutions to uniquely artistic brand development to motion and sound engineering - along with some like-minded people I'm lucky to have in my life. I've previously worked with a few **_YC startups_** on their products: [ [Replo](https://www.replo.app/), [Osmind](https://www.osmind.org/) ]. I love making cool interactive websites, contributing to open-source (don't get much time for this lately üòî), making UI/UX designs, and learning new stuff.
